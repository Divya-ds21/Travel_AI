🧳 Travel Planner Agent
An AI-powered assistant that helps users plan personalized trips efficiently. Built using IBM Cloud Lite services and IBM Granite, it suggests destinations, builds custom itineraries, recommends transport and accommodation, provides real-time weather updates, and manages travel alerts — making travel planning seamless and enjoyable.


🧩 Problem Statement
Planning a trip involves multiple tasks — researching destinations, checking weather, comparing transport and accommodation, and building itineraries — often spread across multiple platforms. This process is time-consuming, overwhelming, and lacks personalization.


💡 Proposed Solution
